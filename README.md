## Introduction

![New Year's Sales - Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b540145-3bc8-40c6-8391-6f59e2f8af5b)

Using Excel, I analysed a Superstore Sales dataset, with data ranging from 2015 to 2018 . In doing so, I tried to find a way to increase sales in the upcoming year(in this scenario, that would be the year 2019). 

As i was searching for cues at the data, I found a rather convenient solution. *"New Year's Sales"*, a two month period of sales where the price of most products from the Superstore will be reduced.

## Excel Skills Used

This project was made using the following analysis skills:
- ðŸŽ¯ Formulas
- ðŸ“Œ Pivot Tables
- ðŸ“Š Charts
- âœ… Data Validation

## Superstore Sales Dataset

This dataset contains information about the sales of a Superstore, dating from 2015 to 2018 respectively. Using Power Query, I removed data that I considered to be redundant. Therefore, this dashboard includes detailed information about the following:

- Order Date
- Ship Date
- Product category
- Product sub-Category
- Sales

### Sales Growth over the Years

Using formulas, I determined the total number of sales in every year of activity of the Superstore. 

### Total Sales for every month

As I observed an upward trend in sales, I tried asking questions to see if there were any ways in which the Superstore was still lacking. This is where I found something interesting: *Sales decline drastically in January and February of every year!*

In response to this, I came up with a rather simple, yet effective, solution. A two month period of time where most of the Superstore's products will be for sale - *New Year's Sales*.

### Which products are going to be on sale?

This is where i used Pivot Tables to determine which products were the best sold and which ones were underperforming, when taking into account all the years of activity. In doing so, I found the top 5 best selling products and the worst 5 selling products. 

What I proposed was the following: *Don't reduce the price for our best selling products, have them reduced by 20% for our worst selling ones, and the products that remain by 10%.*

The reasoning behind this was as follows: we shouldn't cut the price of products that are already performing well, but we should incetivize the purchase of products that are underperfoming. Thus, according to the performance in sales of the products, different percentages were determined.

### What is the impact of the "New Year's Sales"?

The average annual sales growth, starting from 2015 until 2018, was of *15%*, with the products at full prices. When taking into consideration such growth, a 25% growth in sales, regarding the products that are included in the sales, is plausible. 

In this case, the total sales **for the upcoming year** are to be increased by *7%*.

### Conclusion

Overall, upon expecting this dataset, I was able to:

- use multiple Excel skills in order to analyse the data;
- find a problem that the Superstore was facing;
- come up with a solution;
- visualize my findings in an easy to understand manner.

Using Excel, I analyzed a Superstore Sales dataset covering data from 2015 to 2018. My goal was to identify opportunities to increase sales in the upcoming year (in this scenario, 2019).

While exploring the data, I discovered a recurring issue: **sales drop significantly in January and February each year**. This led me to a targeted and cost-effective solution—*"New Year's Sales"*, a two-month promotional campaign offering discounts on most products in the store.

- 🎯 Formulas
- 📌 Pivot Tables
- 📊 Charts
- ✅ Data Validation

## Superstore Sales Dataset

The dataset contains transactional data from a retail Superstore between 2015 and 2018. After cleaning it using Power Query, I focused on key fields relevant to sales analysis:

- Order Date  
- Ship Date  
- Product Category  
- Product Sub-Category  
- Sales

### 📈 Sales Growth Over the Years

Using formulas, I calculated the total sales for each year. The results revealed a consistent upward trend in overall performance.

### 📉 Monthly Sales Fluctuation

Despite the overall growth, sales dropped dramatically every January and February. This seasonal decline indicated a missed opportunity during a post-holiday slump.  
**Solution:** Launch a *"New Year's Sales"* campaign during these months to stimulate demand.

### 🛍️ Discount Strategy: Which Products Go on Sale?

Using Pivot Tables, I identified both high- and low-performing products based on total sales over four years. The results informed a tiered discount model:

#### Discount Strategy

- **Top 5 best-selling products** → 0% discount (retain full price to protect margins)  
- **Bottom 5 worst-selling products** → 20% discount (encourage demand)  
- **All other products** → 10% discount (moderate incentive)

This approach ensures profitability while boosting sales for underperforming products.

### 📊 Estimated Impact of "New Year's Sales"

Historically, the store experienced an average **annual growth of 15%** with full-priced products. Assuming a modest 25% boost in sales **only for discounted items**, the campaign could raise **total yearly sales by approximately 7%**.

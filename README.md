Using Excel, I analysed a Superstore Sales dataset, with data ranging from 2015 to 2018 . In doing so, I tried to find a way to increase sales in the upcoming year(in this scenario, that would be the year 2019). 

As i was searching for cues at the data, i found a rather convinient solution. *"New Year's Sales"*, a two month period of sales where the price of most products from the Superstore will be reduced.

## Excel Skills Used

This project was made using the following analysis skills:
- ðŸŽ¯ Formulas
- ðŸ“Œ Pivot Tables
- ðŸ“Š Charts
- âœ… Data Validation

## Superstore Sales Dataset

This dataset contains information about the sales of a Superstore, dating from 2015 to 2018 respectively. Using Power Query, i managed to filter data that i considered to be redundant. Therefore, this dashboard includes detailed information about the following:

- Order Date
- Ship Date
- Product category
- Product sub-Category
- Sales

### Sales Growth over the Years

Using formulas, i managed to find the total number of sales in every year of activity of the Superstore. 

### Total Sales for every month

As i saw an ascending trend in sales, i tried asking questions to see if there were any ways in which the Superstore was still lacking. This is where i found something interesting: *Sales decline drastically in January and February of every year!*

I found a rather simple, but effective, solution to this problem. A two month period of time where most of the Superstore's products will be for sale - *New Year's Sales*.

### Which products are going to be on sale?

This is where i used Pivot Tables to determine which products were the best sold and which ones were underperforming. In doing so, i found the top 5 best selling products and the worst 5 selling products.

What i proposed was the following: *Don't reduce the price for our best selling products, have them reduced by 20% for our worst selling ones, and the products that remain by 10%.*

### What is the impact of the "New Year's Sales"?

If an expected 25% growth in sales(only for the products that are included in the sales), the total sales for the upcoming year are to be increased by *7%*.

Conclusion

Overall, using multiple analysis skills in Excel, a solution to increasing the total sales for the Superstore was found, without much sacrifice.

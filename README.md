![New Year's Sales - Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b540145-3bc8-40c6-8391-6f59e2f8af5b)

Using Excel, I analysed a Superstore Sales dataset, with data ranging from 2015 to 2018 . In doing so, I tried to find a way to increase sales in the upcoming year(in this scenario, that would be the year 2019). 

As i was searching for cues at the data, i found a rather convinient solution. *"New Year's Sales"*, a two month period of sales where the price of most products from the Superstore will be reduced.
